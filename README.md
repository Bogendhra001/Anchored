# Anchored

Anchors is a web application built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Servlet, JDBC connections, and MySQL database.
The application provides a user-friendly platform for sailors and boat owners to enter and store information about their vessels and
crew, including personal details and vessel specifications. Users can also bind boats to sailors, remove sailors or boats from the
database, and search for specific sailors or boats using keywords.
Anchors is a versatile tool that is perfect for anyone who needs to manage their boat or crew data. The application is built using the
latest technology and is optimized for performance, making it fast and responsive. Whether you need to manage a small personal
vessel or an entire fleet, Anchors can help you streamline your data management needs.
